## Training Set: 
The training set is the portion of the data that is used to train the machine learning model. It contains labeled data, where the input features and output labels are known. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation and test sets.

## Validation Set: 
The validation set is a portion of the data that is used to evaluate the performance of the model during the training process. It is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, regularization, and activation functions, to improve the model's accuracy on the test set.

## Test Set: 
The test set is the portion of the data that is used to evaluate the performance of the model after training. It is used to simulate real-world scenarios and determine how well the model performs on new, unseen data.

## Hold-Out Validation
A technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. It involves splitting the available data into a training set and a validation set, where the training set is used to train the model, and the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
